title: 7.response

在上一节中，我们打印了响应拦截器中的 `response`。

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oneyoung19/vuepress-blog-img/main/img/20230218160158.png)

我们对这几项属性做一下对应说明：

```js
{
  // `config` is the config that was provided to `axios` for the request
  config: {},

  // `data` is the response that was provided by the server
  data: {},

  // `headers` the HTTP headers that the server responded with
  // All header names are lower cased and can be accessed using the bracket notation.
  // Example: `response.headers['content-type']`
  headers: {},

  // `request` is the request that generated this response
  // It is the last ClientRequest instance in node.js (in redirects)
  // and an XMLHttpRequest instance in the browser
  request: {},

  // `status` is the HTTP status code from the server response
  status: 200,

  // `statusText` is the HTTP status message from the server response
  // As of HTTP/2 status text is blank or unsupported.
  // (HTTP/2 RFC: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-8.1.2.4)
  statusText: 'OK'
}
```
